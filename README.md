The "Quiz App" project aims to create an interactive quiz application in Python using the Tkinter library. 
The application presents users with multiple-choice questions, allowing them to select answers and receive immediate feedback. 
The primary goal is to demonstrate the use of Tkinter for creating a graphical user interface (GUI) and implement a basic quiz functionality.
